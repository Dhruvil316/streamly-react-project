# Streamly ‚Äì React Video Streaming App
> **NOTE:**  I used the `Dboy3` GitHub account to host the code, which also belongs to me. For portfolio purposes, I have included this project on my current GitHub profile as well. Both accounts are mine.

## 1. What this project is about üßë‚Äçüíª

I built **Streamly**, a simple React-based video streaming app, to demonstrate how video content can be browsed, searched, and played‚Äîall in the browser. I wanted to explore React components, state management, and layout designs while creating something fun and interactive.

## 2. Features

1. **Homepage with Video Feed**  
   - Displays a list of videos with thumbnail, title, and channel info, using mock data or a provided API.

2. **Search Functionality**  
   - I added a search bar so users can filter videos by title‚Äîmaking the app feel more dynamic.

3. **Video Detail View**  
   - Clicking on a video opens a detail page where it plays, and shows its title, description, and basic metadata.

4. **Responsive Design**  
   - I used CSS modules (or styled-components) to make the app look good and adjust layouts for desktop and mobile screens.
